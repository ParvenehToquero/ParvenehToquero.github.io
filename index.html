        Hello, my name is Parveneh Toquero. I am a Pre-Business student at University of California Riverside. I am an immigrant from the Philippines and had lived in the United States for 8 years. I am fluent 2 languages, English and Tagalog, and learning two more, Japanese and Spanish. I had a previous work experience in a dental office as a clerk, and I worked there during the duration of my summer break before my senior year of high school. I had also completed an upwards of 500 hours of community service at an organization called the boys and girls club. I am also an avid reader, and an experienced artist that has been practicing for 7 years. I also had experience in playing instruments such as the piano and also guitar, as well as participating in sports, mainly volleyball for four years. As a first generation college student in the United States, and a daughter of immigrant parents, i have learned to step up above what is expected of me in order to achieve my goals. Growing up in the Philippines, I grew up in a very different circumstance than in what I currently am in now. I had to adjust, and learn how to function in a entirely different environment, as well as adapt to a new language. Also, as an older sister, I aspire to be the best version of myself to set an example for those who are younger than me. I graduated in the honor roll in my high school, as well as entering a prestigious college. I had always been curious, and picked up a few skill throughout the year. These include a few of the above-mentioned skills, but also as well as less obvious ones, such as time management, discipline, organization, but also kindness. I am an aspiring lawyer, and am in the Pre-Law route. As the first to do this in my family, I am left alone to navigate through this chapter in my life, and I always make sure to make use of all my resources and make connections. I am currently a part of Acts of Fellowship, a Christian club that brings together college students under the idea of God, and also Nikkei Student Union, a Japanese American social-club. I am also currently attending Starving Artists, an organization that brings together artists of all kinds to share their common interests in arts, games, and many more. I continue to explore new possibilities even in college, and make sure to make use and explore every opportunity that is presented to me. In high school, I also did community service not only at the Boys and Girls Club, but also the Santa Monica Public library, organizing events and offering tutoring help to children, and also helped with aiding the homeless at Saint Monicaâ€™s Catholic Church in Santa Monica during the duration of my highschool years. I also attend church and participate in community service at the Saint Juliana Catholic Church in Fullerton California.<br><br>
